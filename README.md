Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline of designing,developing and testing and maintaining software applications.It has the following importance in the technology industry,
a) Quality and Reliability where the software engineeering practices are crucial for ensuring the software works correctly and reliably.
b) Efficiency and Scalability.In a rapidly evolving tech landscape,businesses need software that can handle increased usage,new features and larger data sets.
c) Security and privacy.With increasing cyber threats,security is more important than ever,Software engineering ensures that secure coding practices,encryption and other techniques are intergrated into software development to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust.
d) Cost effectiveness.By following sound engineering principles,software engineers can help companies avoid costly mistakes,prevent code bloat and create software that is more maintainable over time.
e) Collaboration and teamwork.Software engineering is rarely done by one person.It involves collaboration between different teams,(eg developers, designers) and stakeholders (eg business owners)
f) Innovation. The technology industry is driven by innovation .Software engineering allows companies to create innovative solutions,whether through new software tools,mobile apps and cloud based services that connect users around the world. 
g) User centered designs. Soft ware engineers work alongside designers and user experience  experts to create software that is user friendly and intuitive.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) The birth of programming and early software development.
In this early stages of computing,software was developed using machine level code (binary)
b) The Software crisis and birth of software engineering 
As computers become more widespread in the industry and business,it become more clear that traditional programming methods were insufficient for managing increasingly complex software systems.
c)Agile Methodology and The Rise of Iterative Development 
Limitations of traditional methodologies became apparent especially in terms of there rigidity and inability to adapt quickly to changing requirements .In response,Agile methodologies gained widspread popularity.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning and requirement gathering.
Projects goals,objectives and requirements are gathered from stakeholders.Detailed discussions take place to understand what the software needs to achieve.
b) System Design
Softwares architecture is designed based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase.
c) Implementation (coding and development)
The actual coding or the development of the software occurs in this phase
d) Testing 
The software undergoes through testing to ensure that it works as expected.
e) Deployment
After testing the software is released to the production environment.
f) Maintenance and support. 
Provide ongoing support,updates and improvements.
Regularly update the software to address bugs,security vulnerabilities and user feedback.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a) Waterfall requires linear and sequential approach while agile requires iterative and incremental approach
b) Waterfall is defined with a phace process with no overlap while agile is defined with a process of continous sprints. 
c) Waterfall requires defined and stable upfront while agile requires evolving and flexible upfront.
d) Waterfall is based on heavy documentation while agile is based on simple,minimal focus and documentation.
When to use each methodology 
a) Waterfall ideal when:
Requirements are well understood and are unlikely to change.
The project is small,simple or highly regulated.
There is need for clear,comprehensive documentation.
You have fixed timeline and budget.
b) Agile is ideal when:
Requirements are likely to evolve or aren't fully known at the start.
The project is complex,large scale or has high uncertainity.
Frequent customer feedback is required.
Quick releases and iterative improvements are essential.
Both agile and waterfall methodologies have there own strengths and are suitable for different types of projects.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software Developer
Responsible for the design,development and implementation of software applications.They design software solutions,coding,unit testing,debugging and troubleshooting,collaboration,version control and documentation.
b) A Quality Assurance Engineer
Responsible for ensuring that the software meets the required quiality.They engage in test planning,manual and automated testing,bug identification,regression testing,performance and stress testing
c) Project Manager
Responsible for overseeing the entire software development process,ensuring that the project is completed on time,within scope and within budget.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) Importance of IDEs 
Increased productivity
Error reduction
Enhanced Collaboration
Optimized workflow,,IDEs include the following Visual studio,Eclipse
b) Importance of VCS 
Collaboration and teamwork
Tracking changes
Documentation
Disaster recovery
Code integrity,,,VCS include the following Git,Subversion,Mercurial
When IDEs and VCS are combined they provide a seamless development environments.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
Debugging software,especially in complex systems
Managing complex code systems
Managing time and meeting deadline 
Communication and collaborations in teams
Handling changing requirements
Strategies to overcome the challenges
Unit testing
Logging and monitoring
Adopting design patterns 
Modularization
Agile methodology 
Task Priotization
Time management
Collaboration tools
Realistic estimation
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit testing,, involves testing individual units or components of the software,it ensures correct functionality and also facilitates refactoring.
b) Integration Testing,,focuses on verifying that different modules or components of a software work together as expected.Helps to identify interface issues,ensures data flow and test component dependencies.
c) System Testing,, involves testing the entire system as a whole,,helps majorly in performance evaluation,verifies compliance and also bug detection.
d) Acceptance testing,,performed to determine whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end users.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering refers to the  process of designing,refining and optimizing the inputs (prompts) given to an AI model,particularly large language models like OpenAI's GPT  
Its important in the following ways in interacting with AI models
a) Maximise AI Model Performance
b) Saves time and resources
c) Enables control over the AI's behaviour 
d) Enhances the models ability to handle complex queries

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt example 'TELL ME ABOUT THE ECONOMY',,, It's vague because its too broad and lacks clarity about what specifically the user is interested in regarding the economy.
Improved Prompt example 'EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE U.S ECONOMY IN 2023'
Why it's more effective:
a) Topic is Focused
b) Has a time frame 
c) Has a targeted audience
